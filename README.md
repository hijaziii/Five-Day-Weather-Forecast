# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

As a developer I have generated a Weather Dashboard using Server-Side API (OpenWeather API). 
This weather dashboard allow users to check weather forecast up to 5 busniess days where users can plan accordinaly. 
when users search for a city they will be presented with current and future weather conditions and will be stored to the search history.
When searched, users will see city name, day and date, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, the wind speed and the UV index with color that indicates the conditions. Then users can check 5 days forcast that displays, day and date, icons representing weather conditions, the temperature and the humidity. 
This weather dashbord allow users to check previous searched cities by clicking on it and also have the option to clear all the history that is saved in local storage anytime they want by clicking on clear history button.
